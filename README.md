Objective:
Companies are competing to reduce the cost for space travel and the most successful is SpaceX. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore, if we can create a machine learning model using public information to predict if the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

Problems to be answered:
What are the import factors that determine if the first stage will land successfully?
Which factors affect the landing success rate the most?
Which machine learning model gives the most accurate prediction?
